        <h1>Beef Burrito</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Beef Filling is the main flavour component in this burrito recipe. It’s highly seasoned and juicy so it provides the “wetness” in the burrito as well as the flavour mixing through the other ingredients when you roll it up.</p>
        <p>So other than the Beef Burrito Filling, there’s endless possibilities for what to put in the burrito!</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef Burrito Filling</li>
            <li>Plain White Rice</li>
            <li>Corn</li>
            <li>Black Beans</li>
            <li>Cabbage or Lettuce</li>
            <li>Diced Tomato</li>
            <li>Red Onion</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Coriander/Cilantro</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes until onion is lightly browned. Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until it turns from red to brown.</li>
            <li>Add Taco Seasoning (or use 1 packet store bought) and cook for 1 minute. Then add tomato paste and water, cook for 3 minutes until the water is mostly evaporated but the beef is still juicy, not dried out. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes – piping hot filling will steam the burrito, making the tortilla soggy.</li>
            <li>Optional: If not warming rolled burrito, warm the tortillas before rolling (per packet directions).</li>
            <li>Place a burrito on a work surface. Place 1/4 - 1/3 cup of rice just below the centre. Top with 1/4 - 1/3 cup beef, then some lettuce, corn, black beans, tomato,  a sprinkle of red onion, coriander and cheese.</li>
            <li>Fold up the bottom to cover the filling then fold the edges in (video helpful to see how to do this). Roll up tightly, then wrap in foil. Serve as is or heat per below.</li>
            <li>HEATING: To warm through, pan fry (dry pan) in the foil over medium high heat for a few minutes on each side to slightly crisp and warm the outside. Or for 10+ minutes on a medium low heat if you want to melt the cheese. Or they can be baked at 180C/350F for 20 minutes in the foil – this will warm them all the way through and crisp up the tortilla slightly. If they are straight from the fridge, they will take around 30 minutes to warm through.</li>
            <li>Burritos are best served with something to dollop/dip - sour cream (or yoghurt) and some sort of chilli sauce are my usual because it's easy.</li>
        </ol>
